            Hello! My name is Abdullah and I am electrical engineering graduate.
            However, I found coding interesting while doing a introductory Java
            course in my undergrad. Since then I never looked back. Started my
            journey as a Wordpress developer and doing freelance work on Upwork
            and mostly Fiverr. Worked with more than 50+ clients and with more
            than 150+ 5 ‚≠ê reviews.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate text-xl mt-5 max-w-540 font-light mb-4">
            Fast-forward to today, I work as Frontend Developer mostly using
            React JS framework. Along with frontend I am familier with backend
            tools such as Node JS & Express JS.
